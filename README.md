# ironclad-react-boilerplate
This is my own personal version of a React/SCSS boilerplate starter kit.  
I plan on using then when I want to quickly whip up a new react project.

If necessary, I am going to be expanding on the build script(s) and  
architecture the more I learn about webpack and its capabilities.
