### Starter kit for whipping up a React/SCSS project
  
Please feel free to utilize this yourself if you find it useful.  
**It is still in progress**

I am going to be expanding on the build script and  
architecture the more I learn about webpack and its capabilities.

I may decide to expand on this boilerplate to add an express backend server.  
If I don't then I will most likely make a separate starter kit for a full-stack mern project.

### Instructions
1. Fork & Clone repo to your local environment.
2. Remove/Update the .git directory to the appropriate repo for your new project.
3. Run **npm i** or **npm install** to install all the needed dependencies.
4. Run **npm run start** to start the development watch task via webpack.
5. Get started setting up your SCSS variables and get to coding!
6. If you prefer a different react component architecture or you're not using react-router    
simply strip src/components and src/pages to start fresh
