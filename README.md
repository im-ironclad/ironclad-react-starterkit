# ironclad-react-starterkit
### Starter kit for whipping up a React/SCSS project
This is my own personal version of a react starter kit.  
Please feel free to utilize this yourself if you find it useful.

If I feel the need to, I am going to be expanding on the build script(s)  
and architecture the more I learn about webpack and its capabilities.

I may decide to expand on this boilerplate to add an express backend server.  
If I don't then I will most likely make a separate boilerplate for a full-stack mern project.
